# print(f"{num1} == {num2} : {num1 == num2}")    # 50 == 39 : False. The output is false because num1 which is 50 can not be equal to num2 which is 39.
# print(f"{num1} > {num2} : {num1 > num2}")      # 50 > 39 : True. The output is True because num1 which is 50 cannot be less than num2 which is 39.
# print(f"{num1} != {num2} : {num1 != num2}")    # 50 != 39 : True. The output is true because num1 which is 50 can not be less than num2 which is 39.
