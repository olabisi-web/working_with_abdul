# # Task 1
# # collecting of number
# # Explain each output of the program

# num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
# print(f"{num1} == {num2} : {num1 == num2}")    # 50 == 39 : False. The output is false because num1 which is 50 can not be equal to num2 which is 39.
# print(f"{num1} > {num2} : {num1 > num2}")      # 50 > 39 : True. The output is True because num1 which is 50 cannot be less than num2 which is 39.
# print(f"{num1} != {num2} : {num1 != num2}")    # 50 != 39 : True. The output is true because num1 which is 50 can not be less than num2 which is 39.
# print(f"{num1} < {num2} : {num1 < num2}")      # 8 < 9 : True. The output is true because num1 which is 8 is less than num2 which is 9.

# Give 3 usecase or cenarios where you can apply the program below
# 1. Student Record
# 2. Abdul Company
# 3. Phone Record

# Use Case
# Abdul Company
