# . Simulated USSD Menu Interaction
#  - You are to design a mock USSD interface for a mobile service.
#  - Requirements:
#    1. When the user runs the program, display a welcome screen with a Nigerian context greeting.
#    2. Ask the user to "dial" a USSD code (e.g., *123#) and store it in a variable.
#    3. Print a menu with at least 3 options (e.g., "Check Balance", "Buy Airtime", "Buy Data") using newline escape sequences `(\n)` for formatting.
#    4. Ask the user to choose an option (1, 2, or 3) and store their choice in a variable.
#    5. Use f-strings and/or concatenation to display a confirmation message showing the selected option.
#    6. Ask for an amount (if applicable) and store it as a number using type casting.
#    7. Display a final message summarizing the transaction.

Ussd_code = input("Enter your ussd_code: ")
print(f"your ussd_code is: {Ussd_code}")
# Else:
print("Welcome you can do all your transaction here ")
